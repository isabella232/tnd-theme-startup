# tnd-theme-startup

The tND startup theme is an extensible starting place for a young company who needs a blank slate, but not a blank website. The theme has some standard elements, such as a standard navigation and footer, but doesn't dictate the structure of interior content. We accomplish this by using modular blocks that can easily be added or changed, depending on needs. 



Theme has the following features:

- Themable color set (from the main site?)
- Announcement bar at the top of the site
- Footer with menu and newsletter signup
- Provision for privacy/cookie policy
- Full site search
- Fully functional asset pipleine folder to add features in the future, using Webpack
- Comprehensive SEO, with page-by-page meta data overrides


Blocks include:

- Hero unit with copy and image, optionally add media
- Feature set with images, copy
- List of copy
- Item boxes

Page types may include:

- about/founders
- product
- news/blog list + single pages
